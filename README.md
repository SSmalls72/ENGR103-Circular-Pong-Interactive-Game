# ENGR103Final
 
This is my submission for Pofessor Udell's ENGR 103 Final Interactive Game Project. The game is meant to test the reaction time of an individual by having them press a button when a light reaches a certain point. This game is only functional using a AdaFruit Circuit Playground Express board. The game takes in 2 inputs, the first is the button on pin 5 (right of the board when held in relation to cord), the second input is the switch on pin 7. To score you must press the button when the white moving light is over the constant green NeoPixel. The switch is used to change the speed from fast to slow. When a point is successfully scored the score increases by 1, a high pitch tone is made, and the direction of rotation of the light is changed. When 10 points are scored a circular pattern is displayed along with a melody that increases in pitch.
